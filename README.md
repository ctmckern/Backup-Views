In case someone visits this or I develop advanced forgetfulness. These are sql scripts to create a series of materialized views using the chinook dataset that I'm practicing on.
Also it's worth making a point that I should rename these to include the numbered order one would need to make these in since. Not necessarily applicable to all of these SQL statements but
at least one or two of them need to be made after another one in particular is made.
